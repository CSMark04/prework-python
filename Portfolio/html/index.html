                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I am filipino and lived in the Philippines till I was 8 years old. My parents moved us here to the states in search of a better lifestyle and more opportunities. Since then, my parents have put me in a lot of extra curricular activities within and outside of school. I’ve done most of the sports offered by our district and also got into the STEM program which is where my interest in programming first started. Within that program, my classmates and I built and programmed robots to compete with other schools. But when I got to Highschool, the STEM program there was not as active, so I didn’t care to join. Only recently when I had to think about what I wanted to do after graduating high school did I rekindle the desire to program again. I didn’t like the idea of going to college and spending more years of my youth to get a degree so I explored boot camps and committed to Coding Temple.

                <h2>Why</h2>
                <p>
                    Coding is something I found in 6th grade. My stem teacher had us learn scratch to build our base. I made puzzles, games, stories etc.. anythin that my classmates and I thought
                    we can make, we tried. Then in 8th grade I joined our robotics club and learned how to program the robots we competed with and that made me fell in love with programming.

                <p>Going to the gym is one of the many things I love to do.
                    It provides an outlet to let emotions out while also training physically
                    It's also a place where I get to socialize with friends and make new ones.
